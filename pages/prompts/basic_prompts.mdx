# Basic Prompts
Basic prompts are ideal for simple prompts that don't require specific input variables or structured outputs.

### Creating a Basic Prompt
If the prompt was a `Poem Generator`
The file name should be `./src/ai/prompts/PoemGenerator.Prompt`  
And the environment variable will be `process.env.PoemGeneratorPrompt`.

``` filename="src/ai/prompts/PoemGenerator.Prompt"
Write a Poem
```
