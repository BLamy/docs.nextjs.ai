# Getting Started
Getting the starter kit running requires a few steps. You will need to create an account with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/). Once you have created an account, you will need to create an API key for each service. You will need to add these keys to your environment variables.

NOTE: You will only need an API Key for serp if you plan to keep the search tool that is used in the NFLScores demo.
